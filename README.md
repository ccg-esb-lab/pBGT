## Overview

This is the repositofy of our study on multicopy plasmid heterogeneity and its role in transient antibiotic resistance in bacteria. It containes a series of scripts for data analysis at both single-cell and population levels. Central to our study is a computational model that evaluates into the interplay between individual cell dynamics and collective bacterial behavior. This model underscores the significance of plasmid copy number variability and its resultant phenotypic noise, offering deep insights into bacterial survival mechanisms under antibiotic stress and the adaptive capabilities conferred by multicopy plasmids.

## Supplementary Information: Agent-based model

The agent-based model simulates the dynamics of bacterial populations with multicopy plasmids under various antibiotic pressures. It incorporates key biological processes like plasmid replication, bacterial growth, and antibiotic-induced mortality. We use computer simulations implemented in Julia to explore how plasmid copy number heterogeneity influences the survival of bacterial populations, providing a computational framework to better understand the role of plasmids in the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
