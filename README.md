## Overview

This supplementary material accompanies our study on the role of multicopy plasmids in transient antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The focus is on a computational model that integrates both single-cell and population-level dynamics to explore how variability in plasmid copy number (PCN) impacts bacterial survival under antibiotic pressure. Our model highlights the phenomenon of phenotypic noise resulting from PCN variability, offering insights into the survival strategies of bacterial populations. Through simulations, we demonstrate the impact of PCN diversity on bacterial adaptability and resistance, underlining the role of multicopy plasmids in these processes.

## Supplementary Information: Agent-based model

The agent-based model simulates the dynamics of bacterial populations with multicopy plasmids under various antibiotic pressures. It incorporates key biological processes like plasmid replication, bacterial growth, and antibiotic-induced mortality. Through computer simulations, we explore how plasmid copy number variability influences the survival and adaptability of bacterial populations, providing a computational framework to better understand the role of plasmids in antibiotic resistance.
